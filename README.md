**Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers**

In order to use the internet and open the webpage, we must  have the Internet Service Providers to connect our device to internet. Usually, there are large Hosting Providers that provide the connection . The connection is available thanks to IP address that identifies the device you would wish to connect.

DNS is like an address book that identifies the URL ( domain name ) in an IP address and send it to the server, which is the storage of the webpage’s contents.
The contents of webpage are collected by the server and pass several server to server to get to our ISP and appear on our browser.

**Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today**

Internet technology has changed the world quickly in the world community and created the marketplace in the web where everyone can be involved from anywhere. This has also given the possibility to obtain a passage closer to the possibility of having "knowledge rights" for more people in the world by delegating their skills with the opportunity to evolve their skills in the world.

Now everyone has the power to create, change and influence others. Unfortunately this could mean that the influence could be negative. And for this reason, we should also focus on gaining more responsibility for our own act.
